## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to utilize the skills we learned about CSS, HTML, and Git to create an accessible site for the mock work ticket. 
- I built this project to practice using CSS and HTML to make an existing site accessible and easier to find with search engines. 
- My project solves an issue with a lack of alt phrases for the pictures for those that are sight impaired. I added the name of the site to the title. I fixed a link that did not connect to the correct point when clicked. 
- In completing this project I learned to add alt tags to my images to help with accessiblity, to try the links to make sure that they work and debug when they don't.
